# Agentic Dev Pipeline

A portable multi-agent system for autonomous software development with Claude Code.

## What is this?

A framework of generic agents, commands, and a pipeline runner that can be installed into any project. It provides:

- **7 specialized agents** (Orchestrator, Backend, Frontend, Data-Engineer, DevOps, QA, Security)
- **4 slash-commands** (`/ticket`, `/ship`, `/merge`, `/setup-pipeline`)
- **Pipeline runner** for VPS/CI execution
- **Supabase integration** for ticket management
- **Update mechanism** with version tracking and dry-run preview

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the framework (once)
git clone https://github.com/yves-s/agentic-dev-pipeline.git ~/agentic-dev-pipeline

# 2. Switch to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# 3. Run setup (interactive)
~/agentic-dev-pipeline/setup.sh

# 4. Open in Claude Code and run /setup-pipeline
#    (auto-detects stack, fills project.json, connects Dev Board)
claude
> /setup-pipeline

# 5. Start working
> /ticket
```

## Setup & Update

### First Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
/path/to/agentic-dev-pipeline/setup.sh
```

Interactive wizard: asks for project name, package manager, build commands, and Supabase config. Creates all necessary files.

### Update

Improved agents, skills, or commands? Push them to every project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
/path/to/agentic-dev-pipeline/setup.sh --update
```

> **Tip:** Save the path as an alias for convenience:
> ```bash
> # ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
> alias pipeline-update='/path/to/agentic-dev-pipeline/setup.sh --update'
> ```
> Then just run `cd my-project && pipeline-update`.

Updates **only framework files** and never touches project-specific files:

| Updated | Never overwritten |
|---------|-------------------|
| `.claude/agents/*` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `.claude/commands/*` | `project.json` |
| `.claude/skills/<framework-skill>.md` | `.claude/skills/<your-custom-skill>.md` |
| `.claude/scripts/*` | |
| `.claude/settings.json` | |
| `.pipeline/run.sh` | |

Framework skills are added/updated. Custom skills in `.claude/skills/` that are not part of the framework are never touched.

### Dry Run

Preview what would change before updating:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
/path/to/agentic-dev-pipeline/setup.sh --update --dry-run
```

Shows which files would be added, changed, or removed — without making any changes.

### Version Tracking

Each installation writes the framework version to `.claude/.pipeline-version`. On update you'll see:

```
Installed: abc1234 (2026-02-28)
Available: def5678 (2026-03-02)
```

## Configuration

### project.json

Central configuration file. All agents and commands read from this.

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `name` | Project name (kebab-case) |
| `stack` | Tech stack (framework, DB, etc.) |
| `build.web` | Build command |
| `build.test` | Test command |
| `paths` | Key directories |
| `supabase.project_id` | Supabase project ID |
| `supabase.tasks_table` | Table name for tickets |
| `conventions` | Branch prefix, commit format |

### CLAUDE.md

Project-specific instructions used by agents as context:
- Architecture and directory structure
- Code conventions and import patterns
- Security requirements
- Domain-specific knowledge

## Workflow

```
/ticket
  ├── Phase 1: Orchestrator reads affected files (5–10)
  ├── Phase 2: Agents in parallel (data-engineer, backend, frontend)
  ├── Phase 3: Build check (Bash)
  ├── Phase 4: Review (QA agent, optionally Security agent)
  └── Phase 5: /ship (commit → PR → ticket marked "Ready to review") ← STOP

User reviews PR → "looks good" / /merge
  └── /merge (squash merge → delete branch → ticket marked "Done")
```

## VPS/CI Execution

```bash
.pipeline/run.sh <TICKET_ID> <TICKET_TITLE> [DESCRIPTION] [LABELS]
# → claude --agent orchestrator --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

The pipeline runner outputs JSON at the end (for n8n or other automation):

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "ticket_id": "T-162",
  "branch": "feature/T-162-short-description",
  "project": "my-project"
}
```

## Cost

- ~€2–5 per ticket (Anthropic API)
- Haiku for routine tasks (DB, build, review)
- Sonnet for creative work (UI, logic)
- Opus for the orchestrator
