## How It Works

```
Ticket (Board or CLI)
    |
    v
Orchestrator (Opus)
    |-- reads affected files
    |-- plans the work
    |-- delegates to sub-agents
    |
    |-- data-engineer (Haiku)  --> migrations, RLS, types
    |-- backend (Sonnet)       --> API, hooks, business logic      } parallel
    |-- frontend (Sonnet)      --> UI components, pages            }
    |
    v
Build check --> QA review --> Commit --> Push --> PR
    |
    v
You review the PR --> "passt" --> squash merge --> done
```

Two modes of operation:

- **Interactive** — Drive the workflow with slash commands in Claude Code
- **Autonomous** — A VPS worker polls a Supabase ticket queue and runs the pipeline 24/7

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the framework + add CLI to PATH
git clone https://github.com/yves-s/just-ship.git ~/.just-ship
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.just-ship/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc

# 2. Go to your project and run setup
cd /path/to/your-project
just-ship setup

# 3. Connect to the Just Ship Board (optional)
#    Create a workspace + project at https://board.just-ship.io
#    Copy the connect command from the project setup dialog:
claude
> /setup-just-ship --board https://board.just-ship.io --key adp_... --project <uuid>

# 4. Write your first ticket
> /ticket Add dark mode toggle to the settings page

# 5. Implement it
> /develop
```

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does | Autonomous |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/ticket` | Write a structured ticket (bug, feature, improvement, spike) | No |
| `/implement` | Implement from chat context or description — no ticket required | Yes |
| `/develop` | Pick next ticket, implement end-to-end, create PR | Yes |
| `/ship` | Commit + push + PR + squash merge + board status "done" | Yes |
| `/status` | Show current ticket, branch, and changes | -- |
| `/setup-just-ship` | Auto-detect stack, configure project, connect Dev Board | Interactive |
| `/update-just-ship` | Sync project files after framework update | Interactive |

**Conversational triggers:** Saying "passt", "done", "fertig", or "sieht gut aus" automatically executes `/ship`.

---

## Agents

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Orchestrator** | Opus | Plans, delegates, ships -- drives the entire flow |
| **Backend** | Sonnet | API endpoints, shared hooks, business logic |
| **Frontend** | Sonnet | UI components and pages (design-aware) |
| **Data Engineer** | Haiku | DB migrations, RLS policies, TypeScript types |
| **DevOps** | Haiku | Build checks and fixes (only on failure) |
| **QA** | Haiku | Acceptance criteria + security review |
| **Security** | Haiku | Deep security review for critical changes |

Sub-agents run in parallel where possible (e.g., backend + frontend simultaneously), saving 50%+ execution time. Model selection is cost-optimized: Opus only for orchestration, Haiku for routine tasks.

---

## Workflow

```
/implement - chat context or description -- implements -- creates PR (no ticket needed)
                                                                  |
/ticket --- writes ticket to Board API -----------------.         |
                                                        |         |
/develop -- picks ticket -- implements -- creates PR    |         |
                                                   |   |         |
              "passt" or /ship --------------------|   |         |
                                                   v   v         |
                                          squash merge <---------'
                                          delete branch
                                          status: done (if ticket linked)

Ticket lifecycle (Board):
  ready_to_develop --> in_progress --> in_review --> done
```

### Orchestrator Phases

```
Phase 1: Planning        Orchestrator reads 5-10 affected files, formulates agent instructions
Phase 2: Implementation  Sub-agents execute in parallel (data-engineer first if schema changes)
Phase 3: Build Check     Bash command -- DevOps agent only on failure
Phase 4: Review          Single QA agent -- acceptance criteria + security quick-check
Phase 5: Ship            Commit --> Push --> PR --> Board status "in_review" --> STOP
```

### CLAUDE.md

Project-specific instructions -- architecture, conventions, domain knowledge. Generated from a template during setup, then customized for your project. Your content is never overwritten on update.

---

## Setup & Update

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude`)
- Git + [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`)
- Node.js >= 18

### First Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
~/.just-ship/setup.sh
```

Interactive setup: asks for project name, generates config files, installs dependencies, sets up the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace) plugin.

### Update

```bash
cd /path/to/your-project
just-ship update                # git pull + apply updates to current project
just-ship update --dry-run      # preview changes only
just-ship self-update           # pull latest framework only (no project update)
```

Updates framework files. Your project-specific content is never overwritten:

| Updated | Never overwritten |
|---------|-------------------|
| `.claude/agents/*`, `commands/*`, `hooks/*` | `CLAUDE.md` |
| `.claude/skills/<framework>.md` | `project.json` |
| `.claude/settings.json`, `.pipeline/*` | `.claude/skills/<custom>.md` |

### Version Tracking

```
Installed: abc1234 (2026-02-28)
Available: def5678 (2026-03-02)
```

Tracked in `.claude/.pipeline-version`. If templates changed, you will be prompted to run `/update-just-ship`.

---

## Pipeline Runner

The pipeline is built on the [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk). It loads agent definitions from `.claude/agents/*.md`, streams events to the Dev Board, and produces structured JSON output for automation.

### CLI Usage

```bash
.pipeline/run.sh <TICKET_ID> <TITLE> [DESCRIPTION] [LABELS]
```

### JSON Output

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "ticket_id": "T-162",
  "branch": "feature/T-162-add-dark-mode",
  "project": "my-project"
}
```

### VPS Worker

Runs the pipeline 24/7 on a VPS — polls for tickets, claims them, runs the orchestrator, and creates PRs automatically. See [Autonomous VPS Deployment](#autonomous-vps-deployment) for the full setup overview and **[vps/README.md](vps/README.md)** for the step-by-step guide.

---

## Dev Board Integration

The **[Just Ship Board](https://board.just-ship.io)** is the visual companion for the pipeline -- a Kanban board with activity timelines and project setup.

### Connecting a Project

1. Create a workspace and project at [board.just-ship.io](https://board.just-ship.io)
2. Copy the connect command from the project setup dialog
3. Run it in Claude Code: `/setup-just-ship --board https://board.just-ship.io --key <key> --project <uuid>`
4. This writes `api_url`, `api_key`, and `project_id` to `project.json`

Commands (`/ticket`, `/develop`, `/ship`) auto-detect the Board config and use it for ticket operations and status updates.

### Event Streaming

Real-time agent activity via two modes:

- **SDK Hooks** (Pipeline/VPS) -- `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `PostToolUse` events via Agent SDK callbacks
- **Shell Hooks** (Interactive) -- `SessionStart`, `SubagentStart/Stop`, `SessionEnd` via `settings.json` hook config

Both post to `POST /api/events` with `X-Pipeline-Key` authentication.

---

## Autonomous VPS Deployment

Run the pipeline 24/7 on a VPS — no local machine required. A worker process polls for tickets, claims them, runs the full orchestrator flow, and creates pull requests autonomously.

```
Ticket queue --> Worker claims ticket --> Orchestrator runs agents --> PR created
                  (polls every 60s)        (plan, implement, review)
```

### Why a VPS?

- **Always on** — tickets are processed around the clock, not just when your laptop is open
- **Hands-free** — write tickets from the Board, phone, or anywhere — the VPS picks them up
- **Low cost** — a $4-8/month Ubuntu VPS handles it; API costs scale with ticket complexity

### Prerequisites

- Any Ubuntu 22.04+ VPS (e.g. Hostinger, Hetzner, DigitalOcean — any provider works)
- SSH access to the VPS
- **Anthropic API key** — for Claude Code
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** — with `repo` and `workflow` scopes

### Setup Overview

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Provision VPS** | Create an Ubuntu 22.04 VPS with your provider, SSH in as root |
| **2. Run setup script** | One-liner installs Node.js, Claude Code, GitHub CLI, and creates a `claude-dev` service user |
| **3. Clone your project** | Clone your repo, run `setup.sh` to install the pipeline framework |
| **4. Configure environment** | Set API keys and project config in `.env.{project-slug}` |
| **5. Start the worker** | Enable the systemd service — it starts polling immediately |

See **[vps/README.md](vps/README.md)** for the complete step-by-step guide with all commands.

### Multi-Project Support

One VPS can run multiple projects in parallel. Each project gets its own systemd service and environment file:

```bash
systemctl enable --now just-ship-pipeline@project-a
systemctl enable --now just-ship-pipeline@project-b
```

Workers run independently — each polls only its own project's ticket queue, so there are no conflicts.

### Cost

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| VPS hosting | ~$4-8/month (smallest tier is sufficient) |
| API per simple ticket | ~$1-2 (Orchestrator + 1 agent) |
| API per complex ticket | ~$5-10 (Orchestrator + 5 agents) |

At 5 tickets/day, expect ~$15-25/day in API costs. The VPS itself is negligible.

---

## Cost

Rough estimates (Anthropic API) -- actual costs vary by ticket complexity:

| Ticket Type | Agents | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Simple bug fix | Orchestrator + 1 agent | ~$1-2 |
| Feature with DB + UI | Orchestrator + 3 agents | ~$3-5 |
| Complex feature | Orchestrator + 5 agents | ~$5-10 |

**Model tiering:** Opus for orchestration only. Sonnet for creative work (UI, business logic). Haiku for routine tasks (SQL, builds, reviews).

VPS hosting: ~$4-8/month (Hostinger).
