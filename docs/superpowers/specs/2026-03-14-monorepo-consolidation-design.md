# Monorepo Consolidation: Pipeline + Board + Telegram Bot

**Date:** 2026-03-14
**Status:** Implemented (VPS migration + archive pending)
**Scope:** Merge `agentic-dev-board` and `agentic-dev-telegram-bot` into `agentic-dev-pipeline` as a single monorepo.

---

## Motivation

Three separate repos (`agentic-dev-pipeline`, `agentic-dev-board`, `agentic-dev-telegram-bot`) share the same Supabase DB, duplicate the pipeline SDK, and require separate maintenance. For open source, a single `git clone` should give users the complete experience: framework, dashboard, and Telegram-based ticket intake.

### Goals

- **One repo, one clone** — Complete experience without pulling three repos
- **Less maintenance** — One issue tracker, one CI, one place for changes
- **Better local DX** — `npm install && npm run dev` starts everything
- **Simplicity** — Minimal tooling, no over-engineering

### Non-Goals

- Shared type packages at this stage (extract later when real need arises)
- Changes to `setup.sh` behavior (still copies only framework files into target projects)
- Changing how target projects consume the pipeline SDK (still a copy via `.pipeline/`)

├── CLAUDE.md
└── README.md
```

### npm Workspaces

Root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "agentic-dev-pipeline",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "pipeline",
    "apps/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "dev:board": "npm run dev -w apps/board",
    "dev:bot": "npm run dev -w apps/bot",
    "dev": "npm run dev:board & npm run dev:bot",
    "build:board": "npm run build -w apps/board",
    "start:bot": "npm run start -w apps/bot",
    "lint": "npm run lint -w apps/board"
  }
}
```

**Note:** `pipeline/package.json` must be renamed from `"name": "agentic-dev-pipeline"` to `"name": "agentic-dev-pipeline-sdk"` to avoid a name collision with the root package.

One `npm install` at root installs all dependencies. Shared deps (e.g., `@supabase/supabase-js`, `tsx`) are hoisted to root `node_modules/`.

### What changes, what doesn't

| Element | Changes? | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/` | No | Stay at root |
| `pipeline/` | Minimal | Stays at root, becomes npm workspace |
| `setup.sh` | No | Still copies from root-level paths |
| `vps/` | Slightly | Bot systemd service added |
| Board code | Move only | `agentic-dev-board/*` → `apps/board/` |
| Bot code | Move only | `agentic-dev-telegram-bot/*` → `apps/bot/` |
| `.pipeline/` in Board + Bot | Removed | Both import directly from `../../pipeline` |
| `.claude/` in Board + Bot | Removed | Root `.claude/` config applies to all |

## Migration Strategy

### Git History Preservation

Use `git subtree add` to bring in full commit history from both repos:

1. `git subtree add --prefix=apps/board <board-remote> main`
2. `git subtree add --prefix=apps/bot <bot-remote> main`

All commits preserved, `git blame` works.

### Migration Steps

1. **Remove legacy `telegram-bot/`** directory from root (leftover from previous extraction)
2. **Add Board:** `git subtree add --prefix=apps/board` from board remote
3. **Add Bot:** `git subtree add --prefix=apps/bot` from bot remote
4. **Clean Board:** Remove `apps/board/.pipeline/`, `apps/board/.claude/`, `apps/board/pnpm-lock.yaml`, `apps/board/project.json` (contains secrets)
5. **Clean Bot:** Remove `apps/bot/.pipeline/`, `apps/bot/.claude/`, `apps/bot/project.json` (contains secrets), move `apps/bot/telegram-bot.service` to `vps/agentic-dev-bot.service`
6. **Create `.env.example` for Board** — Document all required environment variables
7. **Reconcile `.gitignore`** — Consolidate board/bot `.gitignore` patterns with root, remove duplicates
8. **Rename pipeline package** — `pipeline/package.json` name from `agentic-dev-pipeline` to `agentic-dev-pipeline-sdk`
9. **Create root `package.json`** with workspaces config and scripts
10. **Run `npm install`** at root to verify workspace resolution
11. **Reconfigure Vercel:** See Vercel deployment section for exact settings
12. **Update VPS:** See VPS migration checklist below
13. **Verify production** — Board deploys on Vercel, Bot + Worker run on VPS
14. **Archive old repos** — Set to read-only with pointer to monorepo (only after production is stable)

**Note on git history:** `git blame` works after `git subtree add`, but `git log --follow` does not track renames across the subtree boundary. This is a minor limitation.

## Deployment

### Board — Vercel

Vercel project settings:
- **Root Directory:** *(repo root, not `apps/board`)*
- **Build Command:** `npm run build -w apps/board`
- **Output Directory:** `apps/board/.next`
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (runs at repo root, resolves all workspaces)

Setting root directory to the repo root (not `apps/board`) ensures `npm install` runs at the monorepo level where the workspaces config lives. The workspace-scoped build command and explicit output directory handle the rest.

Environment variables, domain (`app.agentic-dev.xyz`), preview deploys — all unchanged.

### Bot + Pipeline Worker — VPS

Both are long-running polling processes, deployed as systemd services:

```
vps/
├── agentic-dev-pipeline@.service    # Pipeline worker (path unchanged)
├── agentic-dev-bot.service          # Telegram bot (new path: apps/bot/)
└── setup-vps.sh                     # VPS initialization
```

Bot service working directory change:
- Before: `/home/claude-dev/agentic-dev-telegram-bot`
- After: `/home/claude-dev/agentic-dev-pipeline/apps/bot`

### VPS Migration Checklist

1. `cd /home/claude-dev/agentic-dev-pipeline && git pull` — Get monorepo with apps
2. `npm install` — Install all workspace dependencies at root
3. `sudo cp vps/agentic-dev-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/` — Install new bot service
4. `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
5. Stop old bot service (if running from separate repo)
6. `sudo systemctl enable --now agentic-dev-bot.service` — Start bot from monorepo
7. Verify bot responds on Telegram
8. Remove old `/home/claude-dev/agentic-dev-telegram-bot` clone once verified

### Deployment Flow

```
git push origin main
    │
    ├──→ Vercel: builds apps/board automatically
    │
    └──→ VPS: git pull + systemctl restart
         ├── agentic-dev-bot.service
         └── agentic-dev-pipeline@{slug}.service
```

## Shared Code Strategy

### Current Duplication

Board and Bot share:
- Supabase client creation
- TypeScript types (`Ticket`, `Workspace`, `Project`, `TaskEvent`)
- Constants (status values, priorities, agent types)

### Decision: No `packages/shared` at start

Reasons:
- Board uses `@supabase/ssr` (SSR), Bot uses `@supabase/supabase-js` directly — different client patterns
- Types are similar but not identical (Board has UI-specific fields, Bot has Telegram-specific)
- A shared package adds build complexity (TypeScript compilation, exports config)

A `packages/` directory can be added later when real duplication proves painful after migration — not before.

---

## Local Developer Experience

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo>
npm install
cp apps/board/.env.example apps/board/.env.local
cp apps/bot/.env.example apps/bot/.env
npm run dev
```

### Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts Board + Bot in parallel |
| `npm run dev:board` | Board only (Next.js dev server) |
| `npm run dev:bot` | Bot only (tsx --watch) |
| `npm run build:board` | Production build for Board |
| `npm run start:bot` | Production start for Bot |
| `npm run lint` | Lint Board |

### Board Local

Two modes:
1. **Against hosted Supabase** — Same DB as production, only UI runs locally
2. **Against local Supabase** — `supabase start` for fully isolated setup (for contributors without production access)

### Bot Local

Requires per-developer credentials:
- Telegram Bot Token (via @BotFather)
- Anthropic API Key
- OpenAI API Key (Whisper)

`.env.example` documents all required variables.

## Impact on `setup.sh` and Target Projects

### `setup.sh` — No changes

Copies from root-level paths that don't change:
- `agents/` → `.claude/agents/`
- `commands/` → `.claude/commands/`
- `skills/` → `.claude/skills/`
- `pipeline/` → `.pipeline/`

Board and Bot under `apps/` are ignored.

### Existing Target Projects

Projects with the framework already installed (Aime, Aime Web, etc.) are unaffected. Their next `setup.sh --update` pulls from the same paths.

### `.pipeline/` in Target Projects

Target projects still receive a **copy** of the pipeline SDK to `.pipeline/`. They don't import from the monorepo — that would create a dependency on the monorepo being present locally.

Board and Bot within the monorepo import directly from `../../pipeline` — no more duplicated SDK code for internal apps.

---

## Rollback Plan

Old repos remain fully functional and are NOT archived until production has been verified stable for at least one week. If issues arise:

1. **Board:** Revert Vercel root directory setting to point at old repo
2. **Bot:** Restart old systemd service pointing at old repo clone on VPS
3. **Pipeline Worker:** Unaffected (paths unchanged)

## Supabase Migrations

Board's `supabase/` directory remains the canonical location for schema migrations. Bot's `002_telegram_users.sql` is a standalone migration that was already applied — it stays in `apps/bot/` for reference but is not part of an active migration flow.

---

## Summary of Decisions

1. **Approach B** — `apps/board`, `apps/bot`, framework stays at root
2. **npm Workspaces** — one `npm install`, shared dependency hoisting
3. **Git Subtree** — preserve full history from both repos
4. **No shared package** at start — extract when real need arises
5. **Deployment split:** Board on Vercel (`apps/board`), Bot + Worker on VPS
6. **`setup.sh` unchanged** — copies only framework files into target projects
7. **Board:** hosted (Vercel) + local-capable for self-hosting
8. **Bot:** fully integrated feature, not optional plugin
