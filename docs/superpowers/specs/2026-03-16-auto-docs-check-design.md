# Design: Automatic Documentation Check

**Date:** 2026-03-16
**Status:** Approved

---

## Problem

After implementing features, documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md) can become outdated — e.g., a new command is added but the Commands table in README.md is not updated. This currently requires manual follow-up.

## Goal

Add an automatic documentation check step to `/implement` and `/develop` that runs after the QA agent and before the final commit, so doc updates are always bundled into the same PR as the feature.

---

## Where It Lives

New step in both `commands/implement.md` and `commands/develop.md`:
- **Position:** After QA agent (current step 6 in `/implement`, step 7 in `/develop`), before the final commit
- **Executor:** Claude itself (orchestrator) — no extra agent

---

## Trigger Logic

After QA, Claude runs both commands to get the full picture of what changed on this branch:
```bash
git diff --name-only $(git merge-base main HEAD) HEAD
git status --porcelain
```

Combine both outputs for the trigger evaluation.

Based on changed files, Claude determines which docs to check:

| Changed files | Docs to check |
|---|---|
| `commands/*.md` (new or modified) | README.md → Commands table + Architecture section |
| `agents/*.md` (new or modified) | README.md → Agents table |
| `skills/*.md` (new or modified) | README.md → Skills table |
| `pipeline/**`, `agents/*.md`, `commands/*.md` | README.md → Workflow diagram |
| `CLAUDE.md`-relevant structures (pipeline, architecture) | CLAUDE.md |
| None of the above patterns | Skip entirely |

**Scope:** Only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Internal docs (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, etc.) are out of scope.

---

## Execution

1. Run `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base main HEAD) HEAD` + `git status --porcelain` to get changed file list
2. Determine which doc sections are affected (see trigger logic above)
3. Read affected doc files
4. Check if entries are present, accurate, and complete
5. If update needed: apply directly with Edit tool
6. If no update needed: skip, output `✓ docs — keine Änderungen nötig`
7. If update applied: output `✓ docs — README.md aktualisiert` (or CLAUDE.md)

Updated doc files are included in the final commit:
- In `/implement`: doc edits happen before `git add` in step 7 — they are picked up automatically
- In `/develop`: doc edits must complete **before** `/ship` is invoked in step 8 — `/ship` handles the `git add` and commit, and will include any modified files

---

## Output Format

```
▶ docs — Dokumentation prüfen
✓ docs — README.md aktualisiert        ← if changes made
✓ docs — keine Änderungen nötig       ← if nothing to update
```

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do not spawn an extra agent for this step
- Do not create a separate commit for doc changes
- Do not check docs outside `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- Do not update docs that are unrelated to the current changes

---

## Files to Modify

- `commands/implement.md`:
  - Add docs-check as new step 7 (between current QA step 6 and Abschließen)
  - Abschließen becomes step 8
  - Update "WICHTIGSTE REGEL" banner: `Alle Schritte 1–6` → `Alle Schritte 1–7`

- `commands/develop.md`:
  - Add docs-check between Review (step 7) and Ship (current step 8)
  - Ship becomes step 9
  - Update "WICHTIGSTE REGEL" banner: `Nach Build-Check (Schritt 6) kommt Review (Schritt 7), dann Ship (Schritt 8)` → `...dann Docs-Check (Schritt 8), dann Ship (Schritt 9)`
